\chapter*{Abstract}
The virtual Customer Premise Equipment (vCPE) concept has been proposed recently to reduce OPEX and CAPEX. Software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) are key roles for this innovation. This paper proposes a virtual network functions architecture with multiple flow tables. These VNFs are achieved by the synergies between a VNF controller on cloud and an SDN switch at the edge and deployed by the previous HSNL vCPE framework. The customer only needs a generic SDN switch at local network and it is very easy to subscribing different network services, such as Firewall, NAT,  DHCP, and applications quality of service (QoS) by a browser-based dashboard. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of VNFs implemented by the proposed multiple flow table management mechanism. The flexibility of architecture to integrate with other application classification system, such as IDS or IPS, is also demonstrated.
