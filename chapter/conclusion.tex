\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{ch:conclusion}

There has been a significant increase in using SDN technology to develop the vCPE.
However, the studies are most focused on vCPE orchestration, deployment and management, not the vCPE functions.
The purpose of this paper was therefore to discuss about the development of CPE function with the SDN technology.
The proposed multiple flow table management mechanism was used to to implement the vRGW functions and unrestricted the single flow table limitation.
The results of the experiment show that the new VNF provides provides same performance compare with single table SDN application.

Further research is needed, however, the multiple flow table mechanism need more flow rules in the SDN switch.
The mechanism uses more space in flow tables to gain more functionality.
Also, the order of network functions in flow table must be fixed and reduce the flexibility.
As a future work, we plan to study further on the optimization of multiple flow table mechanism. We are still at an early stage of this approach and the full potential is yet to be revealed.
