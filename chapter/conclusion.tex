In this work, we examined a learning-based energy management policy that takes into consideration the tradeoff between the depth-of-discharge (DoD) and the lifetime of batteries and minimize the total cost. First, we proposed a novel battery cost evaluation method that takes into consideration the DoD of each battery usage. We also define the current DoD to describe batteries effect on the marginal cost per battery usage. Second, we utilized the battery cost evaluation method to devise the day-ahead energy management system using reinforcement learning and linear value-function approximations. We transformed energy management system problem into Markov decision process and defined the state transition in our system model. So, we can utilized reinforcement learning algorithm to find the energy purchase policy that minimize the marginal cost. In the end of this work, we conclude that the DoD consideration can help learning algorithm to decide policy that prolong battery life.
